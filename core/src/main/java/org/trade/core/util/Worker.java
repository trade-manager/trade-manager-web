/**
 * The StrategyWorker is an abstract class that you subclass to perform work in
 * a dedicated thread. For instructions on using this class, see:
 * <p>
 * StrategyWorker does all the dirty work of implementing a background thread.
 * Although many programs don't need background threads, background threads are
 * sometimes useful for performing time-consuming operations, which can improve
 * the perceived performance of a program.
 * <p>
 * To use the StrategyWorker class, you first create a subclass of it. In the
 * subclass, you must implement the doInBackground() method so that it contains
 * the code to perform your lengthy operation. When you instantiate your
 * StrategyWorker subclass, the StrategyWorker creates a thread but does not
 * start it. You invoke start() on your StrategyWorker object to start the
 * thread, which then calls your doInBackground() method. When you need the
 * object returned by the doInBackground() method, you call the StrategyWorker
 * get() method. Here's an example of using SwingWorker:
 * <p>
 * ...//in the main method: final StrategyWorker worker = new StrategyWorker() {
 * public Object doInBackground() { return new expensiveDialogComponent(); } };
 * worker.execute();
 * <p>
 * Note that the API changed slightly in the 3rd version: You must now invoke
 * start() on the StrategyWorker after creating it.
